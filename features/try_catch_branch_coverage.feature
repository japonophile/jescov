Feature: Branch coverage of exception handling
  In order to know what branches I have covered
  As a developer
  I want to see the branch coverage of my catch blocks

  Scenario: try-catch block that is never hit
  Scenario: try-catch block where no exception is raised
  Scenario: try-catch block where an exception is raised once
  Scenario: try-catch block where no exception is raised once and an exception is raised once
