Feature: Branch coverage of switch statement
  In order to know what branches I have covered
  As a developer
  I want to see the branch coverage of my switch statements

  Scenario: switch statement that is never hit

  Scenario: switch statement with one case and that case is always taken

  Scenario: switch statement with one case and one default where the case is always taken

  Scenario: switch statement with one case and one default where the default is always taken

  Scenario: switch statement with one case and one default where both branches are taken

  Scenario: switch statement with more than one case and no default where one case is always taken 

  Scenario: switch statement with more than one case and no default where the default is always taken 

  Scenario: switch statement with more than one case and no default where both cases and the default is taken 

  Scenario: switch statement with more than one case and a default where one case is always taken 

  Scenario: switch statement with more than one case and a default where more than one case is always taken 

  Scenario: switch statement with more than one case and a default where the default is always taken 

  Scenario: switch statement with more than one case and a default where all cases are executed
